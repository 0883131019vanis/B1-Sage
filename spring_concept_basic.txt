server -> will serve 
client

hardware port -> usb port, memorycard port, projector port 
software ports -> 
ejb - old concept

f/w -> collection of interfaces/classes/packages
java -> open source, community driven 

community driven -> powerful, current trend
company driven -> outdated/slow

standalone application
opinionated view 
production grade setup 

Configuration? -? 

JAR -> Java Archive files
     -> zip file/ folder containing java class files 

website -> h2db   -> 1 jar file
	-> mysql       1 jar file     different 
	-> oracle    1 jarfile 
WAR -> web application -> WAR -> web archive files

Bill of materials? align version 
spring framework will align(integrate) other framework  -> flexible
 

SPRING FEATURES:
1. POJO -> PLAIN OLD JAVA OBJECT 
2. DI -> Dependency injection 
3. rest api support
4. mvc-> model view controller pattern 
5. create a secure appp
6. batch 


MVC PATTERN:
------------
 -> design pattern 
 -> Model, view, controller

Tightly coupled -> laptop 
loosely coupling -> desktop 
same scenario -> hardware/ software
